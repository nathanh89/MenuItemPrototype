Feature: Create a menu item

As a user, when I look at a menu item, I want certain information. I want to have the name of the item, price, a recipe for making it, a picture of the item, and a QR code.

Given: The data for name, price, recipe, picture, QR code
When: A menu item is created
Then: All the elements of a menu item (name, price, recipe, pic, QR) should be set according to their associated values.

Feature: Add a tool to the recipe

As a user, if a recipe requires extra tools, I want to know what they are. For this to happen, tools need to have the ability to be added to a recipe

Given: A recipe
When: a tool is added
Then: A tool exists within a recipe's tool list
